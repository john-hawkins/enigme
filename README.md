Text based Puzzle Generators for AI Research

This repository contains simple command line applications and libraries
that will generate ASCII puzzles from predetermined distributions. Each
of the generators is designed to use text to create higher level representations
of a puzzle domain that requires the development of spontaneous mental models
in order to manipulate, reason about and solve the problems.

Some CLI parameters allow for generating from restricted complexty sets. These
are used when experimenting with complexity thresholds that affect both human
and machine performance on these tasks.
